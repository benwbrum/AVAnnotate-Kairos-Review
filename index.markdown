     This software review of AVAnnotate takes a unique form and approach to the traditional and familiar reviews of academic material. As a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) for the AVAnnotate project, I engage with the affordances of both the software’s focus on audio material and Karios’s publication format to speak on how my professional experiences inform my opinion of AVAnnotate’s intervention into conversations about rhetoric, technology, and pedagogy. So to not attempt to separate my professional affiliation from my personal review, I draw on how my responsibilities during my year of working on the project have developed a unique perspective on the potential for the software in research in rhetoric and writing. In no way is this review separate from my GRA position, and I understand this overlap to offer insight into where, how, and why this software may be employed.
<br><br>
Part of responsibly navigating such an intersection involves embracing the goals of Kairos and AVAnnotate, which means developing this review with sections of annotated audio organized according to my experience of the software. Therefore, a webtext utilizing AVAnnotate’s software offers the most acceptable intervention into how my positions inform this review. This looks like six sections of recorded audio (with a transcript available) and annotations of such audio that expand, as necessary, on my professional responsibilities’ association. For instance, if in the audio recording I say “I believe AVAnnotate is a tool which allows for sustainable collaboration on audio artifacts with little to no metadata,” an annotation of this quote may state that “I assisted the production of a collaborative digital edition which informs this perspective.” Each section of this webtext is designed to support an ethical and accountable construction of this review.
<br><br>
Not only this, but the above format also serves to illustrate the major intervention I believe AVAnnotate offers: attunement of users to a collaborative act of listening as a rhetorical response to the concerns of audio artifact accessibility. In allowing users to annotate audio and create digital exhibits, AVAnnotate teaches users, as a collective, to actively listen to and use sound as a method for developing access to knowledge and information which is frequently difficult to locate. I find in this review that the software’s infrastructure, collaborative potential, exercise of annotating, audio file hosting, and context curation develop this major intervention.
