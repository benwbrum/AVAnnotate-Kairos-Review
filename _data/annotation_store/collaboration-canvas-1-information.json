I understand the process of forking to be similar to submitting drafts for an academic publication; making small changes and re-forking multiple times can be an annoyance for the owner/whoever the new repository is being submitted to. This requires a learning curve for new users of AVAnnotate and GitHub generally, but once learned the specific dynamics of forking, each user can make this process easier to navigate for multiple parties.",

        "value": "The use of a IIIF manifest to create another project with the same material is not the only use case AVAnnotate emphasizes. The goal of the software is to promote the use of IIIF manifests in LAMs, as mentioned earlier. This will allow for the software's users to more easily work with audio materials. Until that point, it will be difficult for users to use audio with AVAnnotate, but hopefully use of the software will urge more institutions to use IIIF for their artifacts. This integration will foreground the collaborative potential for AVAnnotate, as users can more easily work with LAMs and other users interested in similar artifacts. Again, such a goal is far away, but it makes AVAnnotate an important tool for create a future where audio artifacts are better accessible across digital spaces.",
