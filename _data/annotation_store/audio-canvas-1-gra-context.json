As it turned out, Internet Archive was still the best option for hosting audio, as it's free and easy to use, and its a dependable option. There aren't many alternative options to host audio which meet these three requirements. The other two options are Box and GitHub, and the latter only allows files of a smaller size, which can be an issue for audio of certain length. To avoid the hassle of cutting audio files into smaller pieces, having links which expire due to a lack of dependability, or decreased engagement with AVAnnotate due to a paywall, Internet Archive is the best option to host audio.",

This is a possible solution to inaccessible audio, but it still requires permission from the owner to publish the annotations. And again, without combining the audio and annotations in a single exhibit, AVAnnotate doesn't fully accomplish what it sets out to provide users: a way to sustain access by creating IIIF manifests and annotations in a single space.
