However, this causes major issues for AVAnnotate, and I've found this to deter use of the software. ",

This is because the use of IIIF manifests within LAMs can fix the issue of file access but maintain ownership and rights to the material. As of now, beyond integration of IIIF in to more LAMs, there is no other way to solve issues of file access other than communicating with holding institutions to (hopefully) get access to files. And even then, these institutions may not accept these files being uploaded online to the static pages AVAnnotate builds for users. I see what AVAnnotate is hoping to accomplish, but for now, it's still difficult to work with audio provided by certain institutions. ",
